| February 4 | 10-10:40am  |                                                        I mainly did some thinking about how I would break this down into the most optimal substructure. At first, I had no idea at all, but then I recalled that this problem set shares similarities with heating up, another problem that included dynamic programming. Even with this information the problem set was still hard to think about because instead of an increasing sequence of temps, where I could directly compare each value to another, I have two things to look through. With this, I am starting to think that my optimized substructure would be how many can be strung across both strings and have nodes/neighbors for each string that I would compare. |
| February 5 | 9:30-9:55am | To be honest, I did not have the most productive use of time during class, but I thought a little more about how I would approach the problem set and find the optimal substructure. I was a little distracted after taking the quiz but Mr. Blick suggested that we start thinking as if we already finished half of the problem, a common strategy for thinking of recursive algorithms. I tried thinking really hard of how this information could help me, but all it did was confuse me more. I imagined being in the middle of both strings, each having an adjacency matrix to who can connect to each node if I were in the middle of the node, but that is as far as I got. Hopefully I can tackle this in the rest of v1. |
