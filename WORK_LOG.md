| February | 10-10:40am | I mainly did some thinking about how I would break this down into the most optimal substructure. At first, I had no idea at all, but then I recalled that this problem set shares similarities with heating up, another problem that included dynamic programming. Even with this information the problem set was still hard to think about because instead of an increasing sequence of temps, where I could directly compare each value to another, I have two things to look through. With this, I am starting to think that my optimized substructure would be how many can be strung across both strings and have nodes/neighbors for each string that I would compare. |
